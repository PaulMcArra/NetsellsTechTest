Technical Test for Netsells

Hello..!
Here I have my technical test.
I have use the volley library for requesting json from reddit.
I have use a ListView, as requested, for displaying the posts.
I made as well a Post class to model the data to be displayed.
The design is very simple but enough for the purpose.
I hope you like...!!
Pablo.
